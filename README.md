The `BayesfMRI` R package includes the main function `BayesGLM`, which
implements a spatial Bayesian GLM for task fMRI in CIFTI file format. 

<!-- * `BayesGLM_vol` - implements `BayesGLM` on NIFTI subcortical voxel fMRI data -->

If you use `BayesfMRI` please cite the following papers:

## Function names change

In version 0.8.0 (June 2024), the function `BayesGLM_cifti` was renamed to
`BayesGLM`, and the function `BayesGLM` was renamed to `fit_bayesglm`.

## Important Note on Dependencies:

`BayesfMRI` depends on the `ciftiTools` package, which requires an
installation of Connectome Workbench. It can be installed from the [HCP
website](https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench).

<!-- By default, the spatial Bayesian model in `BayesGLM` is implemented using an expectation-maximization algorithm written in C++. To instead use the INLA package, set `EM=FALSE`. The INLA package will be required, as well as an INLA-PARDISO license for computational efficiency. -->

The INLA package is required, which, due to a CRAN policy, will not be
installed automatically. You can obtain it by running
`install.packages("INLA",repos=c(getOption("repos"),INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=FALSE)`.
For more information, see [the INLA
website](https://www.r-inla.org/download-install). **Note: INLA must be
installed before installing `BayesfMRI`.**

On Mac platforms, an installation of
[Xcode](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/) is necessary to build the C++
code included in `BayesfMRI`.

<!--An INLA-PARDISO license is also required for computational efficiency.  To obtain an INLA-PARDISO license, run `inla.pardiso()` in R after running `library(INLA)`. Once you obtain a license, point to it using `INLA::inla.setOption(pardiso.license = "pardiso.lic")` followed by `INLA::inla.pardiso.check()` to ensure that PARDISO is successfully installed and running.
