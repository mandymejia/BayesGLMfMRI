\arguments{
\item{data}{A list of sessions in the \code{"BfMRI.sess"} object format. Each
session is a list with elements \code{"BOLD"}, \code{"design"}, and
optionally \code{"nuisance"}. Each element should be a numeric matrix with
\eqn{T} rows. The name of each element in \code{data} is the name of that
session. See \code{?is.BfMRI.sess} for details.

Note that the argument \code{session_names} can be used instead of providing
the session names as the names of the elements in \code{data}.}

\item{vertices, faces}{For cortical surface data, the geometry is based on
the \code{vertices} and \code{faces} arguments (must provide both).

\code{vertices} is a \eqn{V \times 3} matrix, where each row contains the
Euclidean coordinates at which a given vertex in the mesh is located.
\eqn{V} is the number of vertices in the mesh.

\code{faces} is a \eqn{F \times 3} matrix, where each row contains the
vertex indices for a given triangular face in the mesh. \eqn{F} is the
number of faces in the mesh.}

\item{mask}{(Optional) A length \eqn{V} logical vector indicating the
vertices to include in analysis. (Currently only for surface-based analysis)}

\item{labels}{For volumetric data, geometry is provided through a 3D
array containing label values for spatially distinct ROIs to be analyzed.}

\item{buffer}{For volumetric data, size of extra voxels layers around the
bounding box, in terms of voxels. Set to NULL for no buffer.}

\item{nbhd_order}{For volumetric data, what order neighborhood around data
locations to keep? (0 = no neighbors, 1 = 1st-order neighbors, 2 = 1st- and
2nd-order neighbors, etc.). Smaller values will provide greater computational
efficiency at the cost of higher variance around the edge of the data.}

\item{combine_sessions}{If multiple sessions are provided, should their data
be combined and analyzed as a single session?

If \code{TRUE} (default), the multiple sessions will be concatenated along
time after scaling and nuisance regression, but before prewhitening. If
\code{FALSE}, each session will be analyzed separately, except that a single
estimate of the AR model coefficients for prewhitening is used, estimated
across all sessions.}

\item{scale_BOLD}{Option for scaling the BOLD response.

\code{"auto"} (default) will use \code{"mean"} scaling except if demeaned
data is detected (if any mean is less than one), in which case \code{"sd"}
scaling will be used instead.

\code{"mean"} scaling will scale the data to percent local signal change.

\code{"sd"} scaling will scale the data by local standard deviation.

\code{"none"} will only center the data, not scale it.}

\item{scale_design}{Scale the design matrix by dividing each column by its
maximum and then subtracting the mean? Default: \code{TRUE}. If
\code{FALSE}, the design matrix is centered but not scaled.}

\item{Bayes}{If \code{TRUE} (default), will fit a spatial Bayesian GLM in
addition to the classical GLM. (The classical GLM is always returned.)}

\item{ar_order}{(numeric) Controls prewhitening. If greater than zero, this
should be a number indicating the order of the autoregressive model to use
for prewhitening. If zero, do not prewhiten. Default: \code{6}. For
multi-session models, note that a single AR model is used; the parameters
are estimated by averaging the estimates from each session.}

\item{ar_smooth}{(numeric) FWHM parameter for smoothing the AR model
coefficient estimates for prewhitening. Remember that
\eqn{\sigma = \frac{FWHM}{2*sqrt(2*log(2)}}. Set to \code{0} or \code{NULL}
to not do any smoothing. Default: \code{5}.}

\item{aic}{Use the AIC to select AR model order between \code{0} and
\code{ar_order}? Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{num.threads}{The maximum number of threads to use for parallel
computations: prewhitening parameter estimation, and the inla-program model
estimation. Default: \code{4}. Note that parallel prewhitening requires the
\code{parallel} package.}

\item{return_INLA}{Return the INLA model object? (It can be large.) Use
\code{"trimmed"} (default) to return only the more relevant results, which
is enough for both \code{\link{id_activations}} and \code{BayesGLM2},
\code{"minimal"} to return just enough for \code{\link{BayesGLM2}} but not
\code{id_activations}, or \code{"full"} to return the full output of
\code{inla}.}

\item{verbose}{Should updates be printed? Use \code{1} (default) for
occasional updates, \code{2} for occasional updates as well as running INLA
in verbose mode (if applicable), or \code{0} for no updates.}

\item{meanTol, varTol}{Tolerance for mean and variance of each data location.
Locations which do not meet these thresholds are masked out of the analysis.
Default: \code{1e-6} for both.}
