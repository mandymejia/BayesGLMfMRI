\title{Smooth AR coefficients and white noise variance}
\usage{
pw_smooth(vertices, faces, mask = NULL, AR, var, FWHM = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{vertices}{A \eqn{V \times 3} matrix, where each row contains the Euclidean
coordinates at which a given vertex in the mesh is located. \eqn{V} is the
number of vertices in the mesh}

\item{faces}{An \eqn{F \times 3} matrix, where each row contains the vertex
indices for a given triangular face in the mesh. \eqn{F} is the number of
faces in the mesh.}

\item{mask}{A logical vector indicating, for each vertex, whether to include
it in smoothing. \code{NULL} (default) will use a vector of all \code{TRUE},
meaning that no vertex is masked out; all are used for smoothing.}

\item{AR}{A Vxp matrix of estimated AR coefficients, where V is the number of vertices and p is the AR model order}

\item{var}{A vector length V containing the white noise variance estimates from the AR model}

\item{FWHM}{FWHM parameter for smoothing. Remember that
\eqn{\sigma = \frac{FWHM}{2*sqrt(2*log(2)}}. Set to \code{0} or \code{NULL}
to not do any smoothing. Default: \code{5}.}
